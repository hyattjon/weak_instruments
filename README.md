# Solutions to Weak Instruments

## JIVE1 and JIVE2 estimates based on Angrist, Imbens, and Krueger (1999)
We use the following formula for estimation of JIVE1:

$\[\frac{Z_i \hat{\pi} - h_i X_i}{1-h_i}\]$

where $h_i$ is the leverage for observation $i$.

We use the following formula for estimation of JIVE2:

$\[\frac{Z_i \hat{\pi} - h_i X_i}{1-(\frac{1}{N})}\]$
